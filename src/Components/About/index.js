          I am a Seattle-based, driven, and detail-oriented full stack web
          developer with experience in JavaScript, CSS, React.js and responsive
          web design. When I am not coding, you can find me producing music,
          watching baseball or in the great outdoors. My educational background
          includes a bachelorâ€™s degree in Communications from Seattle University
          and a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of
          Washington. I am motivated to learn, apply skills and excel in
          building an impactful user experience to best attract an audience. In
          addition, I am passionate about developing apps with a prioritization
          on mobile-first design and am eager to work cohesively with others in
          a fast-paced, quality-driven team to enhance web experience.
