          I am a Seattle based driven and detail-oriented full stack web
          developer with experience in Javascript, CSS, React.js and responsive
          web design. When I am not coding, you can find me producing music,
          watching baseball or in the great outdoors. My educational background
          includes a bachelorâ€™s degree in Communications from Seattle University
          and a Full Stack Web Development certification from the University of
          Washington. I am motivated to learn, apply skills and excel in
          building an impactful user experience to best attract an audience. I
          am passionate about developing apps with prioritization on
          mobile-first design and development. I am eager to work cohesively
          with others in a fast-paced, quality-driven team to enhance web
          experience.
